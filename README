This is a personal, academic exercise that happens to also have a practical purpose.  I've started writing an OO Perl-based package that will scan and backup any LVM-managed disk volumes that are used by KVM-based virtual machines.

The goals of this project are:

 - Provide future reference material
 - Demonstrate use of OO concepts
 - Demonstrate use of Moose and related libraries
 - Demonstrate use of threads and thread controls
 - Create a semi-automatic backup tool using a JSON-formatted configuration file

This software is INCOMPLETE and is an ACTIVE WORK IN PROGRESS.  Anyone is welcome to look at it and use it for their own purposes.
